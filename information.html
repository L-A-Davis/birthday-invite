      <h2>Why</h2>
      <p>Why not? (hehe)</p>
      <p>I typically do not like celebrating my birthday with a party but this has been a year...</p>
      <p>It is not every year that I have had a new lease on life, quit my job, moved to NYC, and started coding school</p>
      <p>All of you have been my friends, supported me, dealt with my crap, and brought joy and excitement to my life...</p>
      <p>... So obviously, I want to celebrate this year with you by asking you to sit through a ballet after a large dinner and wine</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info fancy">
      <h2>How</h2>
      <p>All you need to bring is yourself</p>
      <p>You presence is present enough</p>
      <p>If you would like to do something for my birthday, I have a few links on the next page where you can make a donation</p>
      <p>Or you can just keep in the back of your head a favorable inclination towards me so when I run out of money one day and ask to sleep on your couch, you might say yes</p>
      <p>We will have a selected menu in the private dining area. There will be vegeterian(fish) and pork-free options.  If there are other dietary requests, please let me know</p>
